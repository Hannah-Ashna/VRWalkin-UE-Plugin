# VRWalkin' Unreal Engine Plugin
VRWalkin' is a compilation of blueprint locomotion paradigms for Virtual Reality. This plugin was initially designed to be utilised within a VR Travel Training tool as part of my undergraduate dissertation. At the end of that project, I decided to package and release the locomotion paradigms on GitHub so that others looking to explore the different facets of locomotion within VR were able to do so with ease. In case you're interested in learning more about the research that went with this plugin, you can find it *here [COMING SOON - JUNE]*. 

### Installing the Plugin
I've written up a handy little guide on the whole process that you can find via this [link](https://hannah-ashna.github.io/VRWalkin-UE-Plugin/).
